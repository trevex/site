After an exhausting week stuffed with submission dates and presentations I was finally able to finish my force field based crowd simulation. For the final submission a video introducing the script/tool is necessary as well, so I wanted to share it to conclude the previous posts. The algorithm works quite well and has especially proven itself to work well for high numbers of individual actors rather than multiple swarms crossing.
